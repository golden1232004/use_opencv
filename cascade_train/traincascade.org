* Data File
** the vec file
   The *vec* file is used to store the positive samples. The *vec header* is defined as
   #+BEGIN_SRC -n
   struct VecFileHeader {
       int count;    /* the count of the images. */
       int vecSize;  /* the size of a image, i.e., equal to width*height. */
       short reserved0;
       short reserved1;
   };
   #+END_SRC
   And the *vec file* is defined as
   #+BEGIN_SRC -n
   struct VecFile {
       struct VecFileHeader  header;
       short* data;
   };
   #+END_SRC
   After the file header, there are the raw images data. The pixel bit-depth is *16*, i.e., short. These images are stored one by one and a image is stored row by row. But *NOTE* before each image, there's a byte inserted whose value is not used although.
