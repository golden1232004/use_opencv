#This code uses openCV functions very useful.
#cvExtractSURF, cvFindHomography...

* I made matching code to the class. Class file name is MareMatchingClass.h/cpp.
  You can use my class in the source very easily.

** 1. Create Matching class
      CMareMatchingClass MMathing;    

** 2. Input PatchImg
      MMathing.ExtractPatchSurf(PatchImg);

** 3. Find PatchImg in the background img
      MMathing.GetObjectRectAndBestH(BackGroundImg, &rect4pt);

** 4. Drawing the rect(rect4pt).
** 5. Repeat, go to the 3.

* The class is consist of like below process;
1. Extract Feature -> use cvExtractSURF function
2. Find Matching point
3. Select some feature in the mached feature points, randomly.
4. calculate Homography matrix. This is geometry relationship between patch and background image.
5. transform features in the patch image by Homography matrix.
6. compare the transformed features to the background features.
7. evaluate how much is the homography exact.
7. repeat 4~6 and select best H.
